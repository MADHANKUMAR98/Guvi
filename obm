Which One Should You Choose?

Let me know if you need help selecting or setting up any of these!





Yes, Prometheus can collect all the mentioned metrics (Application, Platform, Infrastructure, and Network) when combined with the right exporters, integrations, and instrumentation. However, it requires additional configurations and tools. Here's how:

How Prometheus Collects Metrics from All Layers?


---

Full Setup for Prometheus to Collect All Metrics

1. Application Metrics (Instrumentation)

Developers must add Prometheus client libraries to the application code.

Example: Exposing /metrics in Spring Boot with micrometer-prometheus.



2. Platform Metrics (Exporters)

Kubernetes Monitoring: Install kube-state-metrics to get pod, deployment, and node-level metrics.

Docker Monitoring: Use cAdvisor to get container performance metrics.



3. Infrastructure Metrics (Exporters)

Install Node Exporter on every VM or physical server to collect OS-level stats (CPU, memory, disk).



4. Network Metrics (Exporters)

Use SNMP Exporter to collect network traffic, bandwidth, and packet loss data from routers and switches.



5. Centralized Storage & Querying

All collected metrics are stored in Prometheus TSDB (Time-Series Database).

Use PromQL to query and analyze data.



6. Visualization & Alerting

Grafana for real-time dashboards.

Alertmanager for notifications (Slack, Email, PagerDuty).

Final Answer:

Yes, Prometheus can collect all the required metrics, but it requires proper instrumentation, exporters, and integrations to cover application, platform, infrastructure, and network layers.
