Top Alternatives to Prometheus for Full-Stack Monitoring

1. Datadog (Best for Cloud & Enterprise)

âœ… Collects: Application, Platform, Infrastructure, and Network metrics

âœ… Supports: Logs, metrics, traces (all-in-one)

âœ… Features:

Auto-instrumentation for applications

Agent-based monitoring for infrastructure

Native Kubernetes, Docker, and cloud integrations

AI-driven anomaly detection


ðŸ”´ Downsides: Paid service (free tier has limits)



---

2. Grafana Cloud (Managed Prometheus Alternative)

âœ… Collects: Metrics from applications, Kubernetes, infrastructure, and networks

âœ… Supports: Logs (Loki), Traces (Tempo), Metrics (Prometheus)

âœ… Features:

Managed Prometheus + Loki + Tempo stack

Pre-built dashboards for infrastructure monitoring

Supports cloud services (AWS, GCP, Azure)


ðŸ”´ Downsides: Paid for large-scale usage, requires setup for self-hosted



---

3. New Relic (Best for AIOps & AI Monitoring)

âœ… Collects: Application performance, logs, infrastructure, and network

âœ… Supports: Full-stack monitoring with distributed tracing

âœ… Features:

No need for exportersâ€”agent collects everything

AI-powered insights and anomaly detection

Auto-instrumentation for applications


ðŸ”´ Downsides: Expensive for large-scale environments



---

4. Zabbix (Best for On-Premise & Open-Source)

âœ… Collects: Server, application, network, and cloud metrics

âœ… Supports: Logs, SNMP, and infrastructure monitoring

âœ… Features:

No need for exporters, built-in integrations for system monitoring

Best for on-premises & hybrid environments

Supports auto-discovery of services


ðŸ”´ Downsides: Complex setup compared to Prometheus



---

5. OpenTelemetry + VictoriaMetrics (Best Open-Source Stack)

âœ… Collects: Metrics, traces, logs (full observability)

âœ… Supports: Kubernetes, microservices, and cloud platforms

âœ… Features:

OpenTelemetry for collecting metrics & traces

VictoriaMetrics as a high-performance TSDB (Prometheus alternative)

Scales better than Prometheus


ðŸ”´ Downsides: Requires integration effort

Which One Should You Choose?

Let me know if you need help selecting or setting up any of these!





Yes, Prometheus can collect all the mentioned metrics (Application, Platform, Infrastructure, and Network) when combined with the right exporters, integrations, and instrumentation. However, it requires additional configurations and tools. Here's how:

How Prometheus Collects Metrics from All Layers?


---

Full Setup for Prometheus to Collect All Metrics

1. Application Metrics (Instrumentation)

Developers must add Prometheus client libraries to the application code.

Example: Exposing /metrics in Spring Boot with micrometer-prometheus.



2. Platform Metrics (Exporters)

Kubernetes Monitoring: Install kube-state-metrics to get pod, deployment, and node-level metrics.

Docker Monitoring: Use cAdvisor to get container performance metrics.



3. Infrastructure Metrics (Exporters)

Install Node Exporter on every VM or physical server to collect OS-level stats (CPU, memory, disk).



4. Network Metrics (Exporters)

Use SNMP Exporter to collect network traffic, bandwidth, and packet loss data from routers and switches.



5. Centralized Storage & Querying

All collected metrics are stored in Prometheus TSDB (Time-Series Database).

Use PromQL to query and analyze data.



6. Visualization & Alerting

Grafana for real-time dashboards.

Alertmanager for notifications (Slack, Email, PagerDuty).

Final Answer:

Yes, Prometheus can collect all the required metrics, but it requires proper instrumentation, exporters, and integrations to cover application, platform, infrastructure, and network layers.
